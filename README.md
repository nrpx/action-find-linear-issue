# action-find-linear-issue

This is a [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that finds a [Linear](https://linear.app/) Issue in your Pull Request.

This is helpful when you're:

- Ensuring each Pull Request has a Linear Issue.
- Making a forced PR title/description updates depends on data from Linear
- Adjusting release notes on GitHub or somewhere else via PRs (actions) and Linear Issues
